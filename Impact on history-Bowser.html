<h1>Mary's Work as a Spy </h1>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"
<p> Mary impacted the history in a very valuable way. She impacted the history by starting to work as a spy in the year 1863. Mary had a near-photographic memory and intelligence; she also had a skill as an actress.
So, she acted as an uneducated, yet highly capable servant, converting into the position of a slave. How I know that Bowser started acting as a slave in the White is becuase in "New World Encyclopedia" is said,
“Elizabeth convinced a friend to bring Mary with her as a servant to social functions held by Varina Davis, who, as the wife of President Jefferson Davis, was the First Lady of the Confederacy.
Mary soon won her confidence and was taken on as a full time domestic worker at the Confederate White House.” (Tanabe-7) This quote informs me that Bowser was a very talented as an actress and how she started working in the White House. </p>
<p> When Bowser started working as a slave at White house, she gathered a lot of information that was valuable, and gave it to Elizabeth, who gave it to the military leaders.
I know that Bowser gathered a lot of information from the Confederacy because on the website “eHISTORY" it said, “The household members assumed she was a slave.
Thus, Davis and his cabinet members, as well as military leaders, spoke openly in front of her about troop strategy and movement. They also took for granted that she was illiterate,
and so she was able to read war dispatches and other important papers Davis left out. Bowser would then pass the information to Van Lew or to other Union informers who would pass her information
to military leaders, including General Grant.” (“eHISTORY-2”) This quote tells me how Bowser impacted the history and how successful she was as a spy.</p>
