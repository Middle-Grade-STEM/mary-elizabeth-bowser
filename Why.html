<h1> Why did what she do matter?</h1>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What Bowser did matter because without her talent, the Union would probably would have not won the civil.
Bowser also risked her freedom and helped the Union without being sure that they would win the war and help end slavery.
I know this because on the website “Amsterdam News” it said, “From several websites we learn that Bowser, in 1995, was honored by the U.S.
government for her dedication, sacrifice and her daring risk by inducting her into the Military Intelligence Corps Hall of Fame in Fort Huachuca, Ariz.” (Boyd- 14)
This quote tells me that Bowser was extremely helpful, and what she did matter as she sacrificed and risked helping the Union.

<h2> Why has she been left out of history books?</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One reason, Mary Elizabeth Bowser has been left out of history books is because there wasn’t information of her to write about.
Another reason that Bowser has been left out of history books, is that all the information that was left has been destroyed by the U.S government to protect her.
The last reason to why Bowser has been left out of history books is that every time she gave a speech, she always mixed them up, which left the historians confused as to what her real story is.</p>

<p>I know that there is little information about Bowser and that the U.S Governemnt destroyed her information is because in the website (“eHistory”)it states, “Unfortunately, little is known about Mary Bowser's life and her work as a spy.
After the Civil War ended, the US government destroyed any record of her, Van Lew and others, ostensibly for their protection. There is no record of what she did after the war, and the date and details of her death are also unknown.”  (eHistory-3)
This tells me that the historians did not have enough information about Mary Elizabeth Bowser to write about her.<p>

<p>I know that Bowser confused the Historians by mixing up what she said was becuase in the website (“History.com”) it states, “Fittingly for a former double agent, Richards’ speeches often contradicted one another,
leaving historians befuddled as to her actual story.”(Morgan-24") This quote tells me that just like a spy Bowsers’ speeches hid what her real story is.</p>
