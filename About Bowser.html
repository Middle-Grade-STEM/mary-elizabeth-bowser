<p> Mary Elizabeth Bowser was born in the year 1839 in Richmond, Virginia as a slave. She was a slave to John Van Lew, who was a wealthy hardware merchant. When John Van Lew died in the year 1851, his daughter, Elizabeth Van Lew,
freed all the slaves on her father's plantation. Even though Elizabeth freed all the slaves, Mary decided to stay with the Van Lew family. "She stayed with the family until the late 1850s."("Mary Elizabeth Bowser-Adobe Spark")
Elizabeth saw Maryâ€™s intelligence and sent her off the to the same school that she studied in, Quaker school which is in Philadelphia. While Mary was taking part in her classes, the Civil War started. As Elizabeth had already started working for the Union,
she asked Mary to return to Richmond, Virginia to help. </p>
